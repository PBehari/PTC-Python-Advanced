    "#   - Pure Functions: These functions have two main properties:\n",
    "#       1. they always produce the same output for the same arguments irrespective of anything else.\n",
    "#       2. they have no side-effects i.e. they do modify any argument or global variables or output something.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#   - Recursion: There are no “for” or “while” loop in functional languages. Iteration in functional languages is implemented through recursion.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#   - Functions are First-Class and can be Higher-Order: First-class functions are treated as first-class variable.\n",
    "#     The first-class variables can be passed to functions as a parameter, can be returned from functions or stored in data structures.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#   - Variables are Immutable: In functional programming, we can’t modify a variable after it’s been initialized.\n",
